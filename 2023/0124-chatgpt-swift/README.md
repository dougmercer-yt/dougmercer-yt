# ChatGPT made an IOS app for me
In [this video](https://youtu.be/uA6DsMt6WqA) ChatGPT makes an IOS app for me.

## Whoops...
Embarrassingly, I lost the source code for this project. ChatGPT helped me produce the app in such a hurry that I never version controlled it, and I evidently deleted the local folder before creating a backup.

Sorry! It won't happen again.

But hey-- I'm sure ChatGPT could help you make a new, better one pretty quickly anyways.

# Marp
In [this video](https://youtu.be/EzQ-p41wNEE) we use Marp to create awesome slides using Markdown.

## Setup
I recommend installing the VS Code plugin as described in the video. However, the `marp` team also provides a Docker image. Please refer to the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in this folder if you're interested in how to use the `marp` docker image in CI.
